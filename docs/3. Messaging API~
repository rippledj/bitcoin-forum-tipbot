Auroracoin Forum Tip-bot API
============================
The documentation for the bland.is forum API is a pdf file in the doc directory.  The file is also available online at: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUsPKKmLg48zbUm4D8Ny6qrqgBYdGv2pbj4-WfibM3g/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1#

The API should be accessed on a cron and scraped for new threads and posts once every minute.  The text of all new threads and posts should be parsed and appropriate functions processed.  All transactions should be pooled and handled at the end.
